            I love making games that are fun and interesting to play. I enjoy
            trying out different ideas for gameplay, stories, and design to
            create unique experiences. Experimenting with new mechanics and ways
            to make a game feel more engaging is something I really enjoy.
            Besides game development, I also like exploring web technologies and
            how they can make games more interactive. I'm always looking for new
            things to learn and new challenges to take on!

              <h5>Rocket League Player</h5>
              <p>
                I'm a highly skilled (or at least I like to think so)
                competitive Rocket League player. One day I'm soaring through
                the ranks as a Champion, feeling like a pro, and the next, I'm
                tumbling back down to Diamond, questioning all my life choices.
                It's a never-ending rollercoaster of wins, losses, and
                completely missing the ball at the worst possible moments.

                I was recognized as an outstanding student in the [course name]
                for my performance and high attendance. I stayed consistent,
                worked hard, and made sure to always be present and engaged. It
                was a great experience and a nice recognition of my effort!
